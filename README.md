index2share
=====

index, choose and copy files

-----------

## Goals

index2share is a tool, to manage and copies files. 
The tools create index file. This copy management are done 
though a file navigator, and moving index files. Then the index are
replace by the tool by the original file.

It has almost no command line options.

## GUI

GUI are not needed, you could double clic on the runme.bat, if the
installation file are copied at the base of a bunch of file. The
program will run, and a console with all the action done are
displayed.

In the futur, index could be include inside the file navigator. 

Please read the README.txt files.
